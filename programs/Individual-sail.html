                        The DSAA offers our members with the opportunity to sail independently on 
                        the Glenmore Reservoir in any of our accessible sailboats: Martin16s, Sonars, 
                        or Access Dinghies. Sailing is unique in that it allows our members the chance 
                        to leave their disability at the dock, and experience independence and freedom 
                        in a way that would otherwise not be available. While learning to sail or for 
                        a therapeutic and rehabilitative outing where the member is not able to sail 
                        on their own, DSAA provides independent sailing with a qualified volunteer 
                        sailing companion.
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        The DSAA staff will ensure the boat and any required adaptive equipment is 
                        ready for sailing prior to the outing and assist in transferring people in 
                        and out of the boat. After the sailing session the staff will ensure the 
                        boats are de-rigged and stored.

                    <h3>Learn to Sail</h3>
                    <p>The DSAA offers Sail Canada certified “Learn to Sail” programs where participants 
                        can obtain their CANSail certification, utilizing the DSAA’s accessible boats. 
                        The CANSail program provides our members with a solid foundation of sailing knowledge, 
                        allowing them to safely sail independently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The DSAA will arrange for a qualified instructor for the course, either a member of our 
                        staff or a contract instructor. Our Program Coordinators will ensure the sailboats and 
                        any adaptive equipment, are setup and assist in transferring people in and out of the 
                        boats. After the sailing has concluded the DSAA staff will ensure the boats are de-rigged 
                        and stored. As required to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience, the DSAA will provide 
                        at least one qualified volunteer sailing companion per vessel to assist in controlling and 
                        docking the boat.

                    <p>
                        After learning how to sail independently some of our members choose to advance their knowledge 
                        and self-development by participating in friendly racing. The DSAA supports these members by 
                        participating in the “Wednesday Night Racing” series, hosted by the Glenmore Yacht Club on the 
                        Glenmore Reservoir. There are no pre-requisites to participate in this event and is open to our 
                        members of all sailing ability. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this event the DSAA staff will ensure the boat and any required adaptive equipment is ready for 
                        sailing prior to the outing and assist in transferring people in and out of the boat. After the races 
                        the staff will ensure the boats are de-rigged and stored. If the member is new to racing and not 
                        comfortable on their own the DSAA provides the sailor with a qualified volunteer sailing companion to 
                        ensure they have a positive and enjoyable experience.

                    <h3>Outreach</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our Outreach Program takes our boats on the road, to venues where local disabled individual and volunteer 
                        enthusiasm combine to bring accessible sailing to a community. When groups representing people with disabilities 
                        invite us to an outreach location, DSAA staff and volunteers transport boats and equipment to an accessible 
                        location to share the experience of sailing with other members of the disabled community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Previously we have worked with the Canadian Paraplegic Association Edmonton Chapter and the Wabamun Sailing Club 
                        to hold Outreach Programs on Lake Wabamun, 65 km west of Edmonton. The DSAA provided a group of 2-3 individuals, 
                        consisting of volunteers and staff, to transport our boats (2 Martin16s and 2 Access Dinghies) and accessible 
                        equipment to Lake Wabamun. The staff and volunteers then ensured the boats and any required adaptive equipment 
                        was ready for the new sailors, assisted in loading and unloading the participants, and de-rigged the boats after 
                        the event. Our volunteers and Wabamun Sailing Club provided qualified sailing companions for the new sailors to 
                        ensure a safe and enjoyable experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Outreach Program is normally held on a weekend and we've previously been to Lake Wabamun and Pine Lake, 39km 
                        southeast of Red Deer. The DSAA only charges the cost of fuel and accommodation back to the organizing group. We 
                        normally see approximately 20 new sailors at each outreach
