                        In 1994, The Disabled Sailing Association of Alberta was formed with 
                        the with the goal of establishing permanent sailing programs for children 
                        and adults with disabilities in Alberta. Now, after many seasons of successful 
                        operations, thousands of Alberta have enjoyed the therapeutic and 
                        rehabilitative benefits of sailing.
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        The DSAA is a largely volunteer operated 
                        organization that has grown into a recognized community service, partnering 
                        with more than 35 local agencies providing recreational opportunities for 
                        individuals with disabilities. The success of sailing as a recreational and 
                        rehabilitation program is evident in both the growing numbers of people that 
                        participate in these programs and the enthusiastic support that DSA Alberta 
                        has received from the disabled communities, community organizations and funding
                        agencies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Association looks forward to new and returning members enjoying the 
                        independence and freedom that everyone enjoys when wind, sun and spray join forces 
                        to make a perfect sailing day.
