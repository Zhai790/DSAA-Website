                    <h4>Details</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Sonar is the 23-foot internationally acclaimed one-design with a contoured, 
                        sit-in cockpit that is 11' 6" long and is self bailing. Angled seat backs and coamings 
                        are designed for comfort when heeled and recessed handholds offer extra security. 
                        The Sonar's sail plan is designed for efficiency and control with a full range of rig 
                        adjustments that allow the crew to easily alter sail shape to changing conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A generous keel and deep spade rudder provide excellent lateral stability and control 
                        and the Sonar can easily turn in its own length. The keel to hull joint is designed to 
                        minimize damage in an accidental grounding.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>The Martin16</h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../images/Martin.jpg" alt="Picture of the Martin16">

                    </figure>
                    <h4>Details</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Martin 16 sloop was specifically designed for children and adults with physical 
                        disabilities to easily maneuver the vessel on their own accord or using power assisted 
                        technology. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The boat is 16-foot and has a 300lb, lead bulb attached to the keel of the 
                        boat which makes it impossible to capsize (tip over). In addition, the inner hull of the 
                        boat is filled with foam flotation that makes the boat unsinkable, even It if it totally 
                        floated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sailor sits in the boat in a multi-adjustable seat that can accommodate any special 
                        postural needs. The seat is situated on the center line at the bottom of the cockpit. 
                        This is the most stable position in the boat and means that the sailor does not have to 
                        move from one side of the boat to the other as one must do on standard sailboats. 
                        If necessary quick-release straps can be used to stabilize the sailor's trunk when the 
                        boat heels (leans to the side) on windy days
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once comfortably seated, the joystick tiller (to control the steering) and lines 
                        (to control the sails) are directly at hand making it possible to sail the boat 
                        independently without needing to change position. A second seat for an instructor or 
                        companion is located behind the sailor's seat.
                    </p>

                    </figure>
                    <h4>Details</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Access Dinghy is a two seat, cat rigged (a main sail only) dinghy operated by a 
                        joy stick. This, along with its hammock seat, allows adaptation to most levels of 
                        physical and developmental disability. The weighted centre board and floatation tanks 
                        make it virtually un-tippable. The Access is used for initial training and recreational.
                    </p>

                    </figure>
                    <h4>Details</h4>
                    <p>
                        For sailors whose disability makes accessing our boats safely difficult we have a hoist which 
                        can be fitted into the pontoon, and is a great way to securely and safely transfer sailors 
                        from the pontoon to the boats. Our hoist is suitable for sailors of all shapes and sizes 
                        and is operated by trained staff. You will soon be on the water and enjoying the freedom 
                        that sailing offers.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Sip'n Puff</h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../images/Sip'n-Puff.jpg" alt="Picture a client using the Sip'n Puff in a Martin16">

                    </figure>
                    <h4>Details</h4>
                    <p>
                        Optional power-assist equipment can be added to the boat to allow individuals with weak arms 
                        to sail the boat using a joystick similar to those found on power wheelchairs. In addition, 
                        for those who cannot move their arms at all the Sip'n Puff system allows them to sail the 
                        boat using their breath! Allowing the individual to sail the boat independently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Sip'n Puff system at the heart of the Martin 16 sailboat allows people with the highest 
                        level disabilities to sail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A small sip or gentle puff of air is all that is required to activate this switch forward or 
                        reverse. The mechanism is completely enclosed within the machine. The mouthpiece ergonomically 
                        shaped to fit comfortably between the lips. The Sip'n Puff is a term used to describe a 
                        dual-switch system which utilizes pneumatic switches. A single piece of tubing, accessible to 
                        the user, controls both switches. A slight pressure (puff) operates one switch, while a slight 
                        vacuum (sip) operates the other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All functions, including setting the sails and steering the boat, are controlled by the sailor's 
                        breath. The term Sip 'n' Puff, is somewhat misleading. Implication is that the user must sip from 
                        the tube, or puff into the tube, much like drinking from a straw, or blowing up a balloon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In reality, the pneumatic switches are very sensitive. The switches are activated by a slight vacuum 
                        or a slight pressure. This is accomplished by creating this vacuum or pressure within the mouth. No 
                        actual sipping or puffing, to the degree normally thought of as 'sipping or puffing', is required.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike other control methods, Sip'n Puff control keeps conductive material away from the user. 
                        This eliminates the possibility of electrical shock.
