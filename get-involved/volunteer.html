                    Becoming a DSAA Volunteer is very easy, and will prove to be a very rewarding experience! 
                    As a DSAA volunteer, you can learn about sailing, assist our community of sailors, staff 
                    and fellow volunteers, meet new people, and have a lot of fun in the sun - all for a great 
                    cause.
                </p>
                <div id="companion">
                    <h3>Sailing Companion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Qualified volunteers are most often needed to accompany our sailors on the water. They may 
                        captain the ship, or simply be on the boat to assure the safety of the sailor and provide 
                        coaching and guidance as appropriate. DSAA Sailing Companions have the option to command 
                        our Sonars, Martin 16s or Access Dinghies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All sailing companions must have their CanSail III (or equivalent) certificate, or similarly 
                        sufficient experience, and a DSAA membership. They also must have knowledge of sailing safety 
                        procedures, and understand how to use our radio system. Our staff are more than happy to introduce 
                        or refresh a sailing companion's knowledge of inclusive sailing technologies like the hoyer, the 
                        autohelm and the windlass system whenever needed.

                    <h3>General Volunteer - Community Events, Equipment & Maintenance, etc.</h3>
                    <p>
                        The DSAA needs general volunteers for our community events (Annual Stampede Breakfast!), equipment & 
                        maintenance support, among others. Some of the areas of support include cleaning the fleet or the facility, 
                        organizing the back storage room, flipping pancakes on a flat top griddle, painting faces or taking photos 
                        and we promise you will have fun!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Safety is a priority at DSAA and it is crucial that that safety standards are upheld and the boats are maintained 
                        in operating condition. Our volunteers help perform regular preventative maintenance tasks and assure that the 
                        boats, club house and equipment are properly maintained throughout the season. It is incredibly rewarding to see 
                        a boat you have worked tirelessly be completed, used and enjoyed by so many grateful people!
